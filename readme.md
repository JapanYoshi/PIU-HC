Pump It Up: Highly Composite is a chart pack for [StepF2](https://stepf2.blogspot.com) or [StepPrime](https://stepprimeofficial.blogspot.com). Highly Composite is a sequel to [Pump It Up Composite](https://github.com/JapanYoshi/PIUComposite), but unlike the prequel, it is not intended to be a balanced chart pack, but a collection of charts I have made over the years. The target demographic is players who can play between Level 5 and Level 17, though difficulties outside of those are provided.

## Background Videos

Due to large file sizes, background videos will be only available separately on MEGA.

# Installation instructions

* Click on “Clone or download”, then click on “Download ZIP" (unless you want to do some fancy keeping-up-to-date using Git).
* Extract the .zip file onto StepF2\Songs\Composite.
(Make sure that you create a new folder first, or everything will spill out into the Songs folder!)
* Run StepF2.
