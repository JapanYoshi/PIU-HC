Pump It Up: Highly Composite is a chart pack for [StepF2](stepf2.blogspot.com). Its goal is to provide an expansion to the song list without deviating too much from the official charting styles. The target demographic is players who can play between Level 5 and Level 17, though difficulties outside of those are provided. Highly Composite is a sequel to [Pump It Up Composite](https://github.com/JapanYoshi/PIUComposite).
